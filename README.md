## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this e-commerce homepage and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard

## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JS, Mostly DOM
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
- I learn a lot about Grid from this difficult challenge indeed.
- I am amazed by how easy to layout the elements with both grid and flexbox together
- I should plan how I approach the project everytime I dive into coding. Remember, 80% thinking, 20% coding.
